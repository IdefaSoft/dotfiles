## Custom script

`~/.config/scripts/wallpaper.py` - A Python script that:
- Sets a random wallpaper from a specified directory
- Automatically adapts niri and waybar themes based on the wallpaper colors
- Inspired by [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

## Installation

Clone this repository and copy the `.config` folder to your home directory.

## ⚠️ Warning

The keyboard shortcuts in the configuration are set up for an AZERTY keyboard layout. Some shortcuts won't work correctly on QWERTY keyboards.
